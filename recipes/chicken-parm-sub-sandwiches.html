    <li>Â½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen garlic bread, thawed</li>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a baking pan with vegetable oil spray.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Place frozen chicken fillets on the prepared pan and bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Turn chicken, sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese on each fillet, and bake until crispy, an additional 10 to 12 minutes.
        </p>

    <li>
        <p>
            Slice garlic bread into 4 equal portions. Open each portion and place garlic-side up on a baking sheet. Warm garlic bread in the oven about 5 minutes.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            To assemble the sandwiches, place a chicken fillet on a piece of garlic bread, spoon 1/4 cup tomato sauce or marinara sauce on top of the chicken, and lay a slice of provolone cheese on top of the sauce. Place 3 basil leaves, or more to taste, on each sandwich, and top with the other half.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Wrap each sandwich in foil and return to the oven until the cheese is melted, 5 to 8 minutes. Unwrap and serve warm.
